# wireshark
To perform network traffic capture and analysis using Wireshark, I first installed the Wireshark application on my system. Wireshark is a widely-used network protocol analyzer that allows us to observe the data traffic flowing through our network interfaces. Once installed, I launched the application and selected the active network interface—in this case, my Wi-Fi adapter—as the source for capturing live network data.

After starting the capture process, I generated network traffic by opening a web browser and visiting a website, specifically “www.google.com.” Additionally, I used the terminal to ping the same website to generate ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic. This ensured that different types of packets were transmitted and could be captured for analysis. I allowed the capture to run for approximately one minute, which was sufficient to record various packet types, and then stopped the capture to begin analysis.

Upon reviewing the captured traffic, I applied filters in Wireshark to organize and examine specific protocols. By typing keywords like http, dns, and tcp into the filter bar, I was able to isolate packets related to those protocols for closer inspection. The captured data showed a variety of protocol types. Among them, DNS was observed during the initial domain name resolution when the browser attempted to access the website. This protocol translated the human-readable domain name “www.google.com” into an IP address.

TCP packets were also identified, which handle the reliable transmission of data between devices. TCP connections involve a handshake process, typically seen in the form of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets, confirming the establishment of a stable connection before actual data transfer begins. Additionally, I found HTTP packets, which represent the actual communication between the client (my browser) and the server while loading the website. These packets included GET requests and server responses, demonstrating how web content is requested and delivered.

Furthermore, ICMP traffic was detected as a result of using the ping command. This protocol is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, helping to verify whether a particular host is reachable and measuring the round-trip time it takes for packets to travel to and from that host.

After completing the analysis, I saved the captured session as a .pcap file using Wireshark’s export functionality. This file can be revisited or shared for further analysis at any time. Through this activity, I was able to gain a hands-on understanding of how different protocols operate at various layers of the network stack and how tools like Wireshark can be used to monitor, analyze, and troubleshoot network traffic in real time.
